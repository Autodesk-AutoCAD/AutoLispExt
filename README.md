## How to use the extension
To debug an AutoLISP source file:
1.  Open a LSP file.
2.  Click Run > Start Debugging (or press F5). 
3.  Then choose one of the following debug configurations:
     * AutoLISP Debug: Launch – Launches a new instance of the AutoCAD application to debug the current LSP file.
     * AutoLISP Debug: Attach – Allows you to attach to a running instance of the AutoCAD application to debug the current LSP file.
    If prompted, specify the absolute path to the AutoCAD executable (acad.exe on Windows or AutoCAD on Mac).

Note: To avoid specifying this path each time you click Run > Start Debugging (or press F5), this path is automatically saved with the extension. For additional information on configuring the extension, see How to Configure the AutoCAD Path.

## How to Configure the AutoCAD Path
1.  In Visual Studio Code, click File > Preferences > Settings.
2.  Under the User tab, expand Extensions and click AutoCAD® AutoLISP Configuration.
3.  Update the Debug: Attach Process setting with the process name in which to filter on during Debug Attach.
4.  Update the Debug: Launch Program setting to specify the path of the AutoCAD executable to use with Debug Launch.
5.  Update the Debug: Launch Parameters setting to specify the AutoCAD startup parameters.

Note: In the following examples, be sure to substitute the path with that of the AutoCAD application installed on your workstation.

Example (on Windows):
* Launch Program: C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD &lt;release&gt;\acad.exe
* Attach Process: acad

Example (on Mac OS):
* Launch Program: /Applications/Autodesk/AutoCAD /AutoCAD &lt;release&gt;.app/Contents/MacOS/AutoCAD
* Attach Process: AutoCAD

For more information, see the [documentation online](https://www.autodesk.com/autolisp-extension).

## Notes

1.	Other AutoLISP extensions may conflict with this extension. If you are unable to set a breakpoint in a LSP file or you can’t use the launch/attach debug configurations, you should disable or uninstall all other AutoLISP extensions.
2.	When using this extension on Mac® OS, the "Launch Program" attribute in extension setting should be ".../AutoCAD &lt;release&gt;.app/Contents/MacOS/AutoCAD" rather than the absolute path of AutoCAD &lt;release&gt;.app.
3.	For AutoCAD specialized toolsets or OEM-based products, the product name might not be the same as AutoCAD or acad.exe. To use this extension with those products, set the value of the "Launch Program" attribute in extension setting based on the product you want to debug with.
4.	If you launch AutoCAD as an administrator, you should start Microsoft Visual Studio Code as an administrator as well. Otherwise, Microsoft Visual Studio Code will be unable to locate the AutoCAD process for attach debug.
