## `Right Click -> Open Online Help`
The original lisp IDE had a button that would open a *.CHM to whatever symbol was currently highlighted. The new right click 'Open Online Help' feature was designed to replicate that feature, but this time targeting the online help system.

### Using the command
This new feature can be accessed through the VSCode Command Palette or through the right click menu while an *.LSP file is opened in the editor. 

* Simply select or mouse over a function symbol and right click to open the context menu
* When the context menu opens press the 'Open Online Help' option
* VSCode will ask you if you want to open the URL
* Select 'Open' and your default web browser will either navigate to help specifically about that symbol or to the general AutoCAD development page when the symbol was not recognized.
