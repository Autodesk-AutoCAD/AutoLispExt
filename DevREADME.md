# Welcome to AutoCAD Lisp Extension

AutoCAD Lisp Extension is a vscode extension for debug AutoCAD AutoLISP. The Extension plays the roles of both debug adapter and language server which could enable you debug lisp with AutoCAD. The following description is for developers.

cd AutoLispExt
npm install --global gulp-cli
python pack.py
```

### How to compile the codes
The script pack.py will copy some utility files to correct location for making package. After run that script and then change some TS codes, you can also use the follow command to compile codes simply:
```
npm run compile
```

## How to debug the extension

2. add some breakpoints as needed.
3. hit F5 and select "Extension Client", then it will start another vscode instance with running the extension. 
4. Do some operations to invoke the codes which are added breakpoints, vscode will stop in the first instance.

## Run tests

You have two ways to run the tests:

  - Run on terminal outside of VS Code and make sure no VS code is running (VS Code terminal will not work due to VS Code limitation) 
```
npm run test
```

### localization notices
It uses the gulp to do localization to reference project https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/i18n-sample
